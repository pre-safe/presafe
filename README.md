PreSafe is a fully community owned (only 5% of the total supply will be used for marketing), low fixed supply and decentralized community token in Pancakeswap.

PRESAFE will be available for pre-sale on DXSale in early-mid-May. It will immediately launch on PancakeSwap with locked for 2 years with all sold tokens and liquidity.

DxSale protocol to foster trust in the community by auto-locking liquidity for 2 years.

PRESAFE is a safe token with the Liquidity Pool locked for 2 years and the contract renounced meaning no one has control anymore no minted function). Thus creating a community token.

The mechanics are simple, the total amount is a maximum of 20000 PRESAFE, but if not all tokens are sold in presale, this will likely be less. Is not it beautiful? Just buy more to hold on.

Simple tokenomics and simple design and no production of token information has catered to the overall success of the project. 100% community owned and driven 
- no rug is possible. #presafe join us on our journey safely to the moon!
